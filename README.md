#PowerCoefficientCalculator
Calculates the power coefficient of a wind turbine and determines whether it is working optimally or not
The file you input needs to be in the specific format that is shown in the example file given. However you do not need to have the time included in the input file. Also, the file name that you input with needs to be the same as the example file shown. 

#Background information
Global warming and climate change have been big issues for the world for the past decade. This issue has not only been growing on us recently but will be a big issue 
for future generations as well. Yet not many people know too much about this issue that is so prominent. So I have decided to conduct research and 
spread awareness about this issue. Through this research I have found that renewable energy is a good way to help mitigate these problems of global warming. Furthermore,
wind turbines are a good way to harness wind energy in order to generate eletrical energy. This helps mitigate the fossil fuels needed to help generate eletricity.
However, despite the many positives of wind turbines, wind turbines may sometimes not perform optimally. Thus in order to help easily identify underperforming turbines
is to use a software, which is what I have coded.
